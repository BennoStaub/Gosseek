-Special letters like äöü are not converted correctly when sending mail: only when you input such a letter in one field it will get sent correctly, if not: you get bad signs. Also, eventhough database is utf8mdb4-unicode or something, name etc gets saved with strange signs in it, nöd as äöü (does that matter, i.e. when writing down username or check for password?)  -> should not use own mail from php, use https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer instead (license?)
